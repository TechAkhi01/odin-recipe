<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Banana bread starts with a thick sweet batter that is full of mashed bananas, ground cinnamon and chopped nuts.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Baking Soda</li>
<li>Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>Softened Butter</li>
<li>Egg</li>
<li>Yellow Banana</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Freezing your ridiculously ripe bananas, preferably in groups of 3, means you're always ready for banana bread.  You can thaw the bananas in your bowl on the counter, or microwave them.  Don't worry about the pool of liquid they drop - the freeze-thawed bananas will actually taste better than the same bananas that haven't gone through the process.  Just remember to peel your bananas before freezing them.</li>
<p><li>Cream the stick of room-temperature butter and 1 cup sugar together with the 3 overripe bananas. 
I typically dump all three into my KitchenAid mixer, hit go, and wander off for a bit.  Be sure to scrape the sides at least once, then mix a bit more.</li></p>
<p><li>Add in the 2 eggs and 3 Tablespoons milk, and mix until they're thoroughly incorporated.  Again, scrape sides as needed between bouts of stirring.</li></p>

<p><li>If you're going to add nuts, coconut, chocolate chunks/chips, or any other extra bits, now is the time.  I generally figure about 2-3 Tablespoons is the right amount to add in.  If you're using big chunks of nuts or chocolate chips instead of more finely chopped, make them heaping tablespoons.  There's really no way to go wrong -  just add things you think taste good with bananas.

<h3>Some things that go well in banana bread:</h3>
<ul>
<li>dark chocolate</li>
<li>milk chocolate</li>
<li>macadamia nuts</li>
<li>hazelnuts</li>
<li>pecans</li>
<li>walnuts</li>
<li>maraschino cherries</li>
<li>coconut shavings</li></p>
</ul>
<p><li>Grease two loaf pans with the left-over butter wrapper.
- Scoop half of batter into each loaf pan, and remove any drips from the edge. 

You may add any extras before or after filling the pans.  Since I tend to leave one plain, I just dump the bits on top of the second pan and mix them in with a fork.  It's a bit tidier to add them in earlier, but I'm lazy.

You can also make this in muffin pans, or an 8x8 square pan if you prefer.  Just adjust the timing a bit, and pay close attention because you'll be using the "cook it till it's done" method.</li></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crispy fried chicken is a standard dish in the Cantonese cuisine of southern China and Hong Kong. The chicken is fried in such a way that the skin is extremely crunchy, but the white meat is relatively soft.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Chicken</li>
<li>Baking Powder</li>
<li>Corn Starch</li>
<li>Table Salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li> For tender, richly flavored chicken, use buttermilk for your coating. (You can also use regular milk or eggs if that's what you have on hand.)
In a resealable plastic bag placed in a bowl, combine buttermilk, coarse salt, and sugar.
Cut chicken breasts in half crosswise. Add chicken pieces to the buttermilk mixture; seal bag.
Chill 2 to 4 hours. Drain and discard buttermilk mixture from chicken; pat chicken dry with paper towels.</li>
<p><li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and ground black pepper. Place ¾ cup buttermilk in a shallow dish. Coat the drained chicken with the flour mixture. Dip chicken in the buttermilk. Coat again with the flour mixture.</li></p>
<p><li>In a Dutch oven, heavy pan, or a deep-fat fryer, heat 1½ inches of oil to 350ºF. Using tongs ($13, Target), carefully add a few pieces of chicken to oil. (Oil temperature will drop; maintain it at 350ºF). Fry chicken for 12 to 15 minutes or until coating is golden and chicken is no longer pink. Drain chicken on paper towels.</li></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
Corned beef, bully beef, or salt beef in some Commonwealth countries, is salt-cured brisket of beef. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called "corns" of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are added to corned beef recipes.
<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul>
<li>One 3 lb. corned beef brisket in brine.</li>
<li>16 cups cold water.</li>
<li>2 bay leave.</li>
<li>6 all spice berries.</li>
<li>3 whole cloves.</li>
<li>Mustard for serving.</li>
<li>A Large Dutch Oven.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li> Toast the peppercorns, mustard seeds, and coriander seeds in a skillet, then use the flat side of a large knife to smash them. Mix them with the remaining spice blend ingredients. Combine 1/2 gallon of water, kosher salt, sugar, pink salt, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of pickling spice in a large pot.</li>
<p><li>Bring the brine to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.</li></p>
<p><li>Combine the brine with 1/2 gallon of ice and water in a container large enough to hold the brisket.</li></p>
<p><li>Add the brisket to the cold brine.</li></p>
<p><li>Submerge the brisket in the brine.</li></p>
<p><li>Cover and chill for 5 days, flipping the brisket occasionally.</li></p>
<p><li>Drain and rinse the brisket. Place the brisket in a pot large enough to hold the meat and add enough water to cover it.</li></p>
<p><li>Add 2 tablespoons of pickling spice, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cook until fork tender, replenishing the water, if needed.</li></p>
